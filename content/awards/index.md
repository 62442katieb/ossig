**Update: Like the OHBM meeting, we have decided to run all of the OS-SIG 2020 events virtually.** We are planning for the OHBM Brainhack to take place online in the days before the OHBM meeting and are working hard to build an exciting online experience that will maintain active participation. 

We have to postpone our selection process for the travel awards until we have a better understanding of how the activities of the OS-SIG will be impacted.

If you'd like to help out the OS-SIG, we are now seeking volunteers from the community to help us run our events, please fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/14qkXPYB5265ZvfPA) to join us!
