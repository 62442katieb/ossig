# Make a difference: join the OS SIG!

We are excited to announce this year's Nominations for the OHBM open-science Special Interest Group (OS SIG) for OHBM 2021!

Please self-nominate yourself [HERE](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAMAAC9pqdJUN0xITDMxUktDT0RCUjJMVlc1OTVSRTlTRS4u!)

The open-science movement is one of the best things happening in neuroscience. Hackathons, open-science room, new tools and methods, reproducibility and reliability, open access and inclusivity: the OS SIG is the place where it’s all happening!

If open-science excites you and you want to help push its frontiers, please consider applying for a position in the OS SIG! 

Early career researchers (Link to SIG), BIPOC, LGBTQ+ (Link to SIG), and people from outside Europe and North America especially encouraged to apply! 

All OS_SIG members have reduced or no-cost registration for OHBM 2021!

We have MANY opportunities to get involved with open-science and OHBM if you think nominating yourself for a position in the OS SIG is more time than you’d like to commit, please reach out to us about volunteering!

We are looking for a group of interested volunteers to help coordinate the international effort of creating Hackathons and the open-science Room! Please join us!

If you’re interested in taking your open-science skills to the next level, consider applying for our open-science Fellows program (more information coming in early fall).
