**Update: Like the OHBM meeting, we have decided to run all of the OS-SIG 2020 events virtually.** We are planning for the Open Science Room (OSR) to run online in parallel to the main meeting and are working hard to build an exciting online experience that will maintain active participation. 

We are now seeking volunteers from the community to help us run our events, please fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/14qkXPYB5265ZvfPA) to join us!
